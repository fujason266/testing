# Code description

# This is an extract of the python code that I wrote to perform some analysis on the Latitude dataset with regards to financial entities' income application.
# In the code, I've done a bit of data cleaning like doing date checks, and then exploring the data by looking at distributions and did some data manipulation too
# there's a decent amount of comments slotted in the code for readability and the actual code only comprise of around 100 lines.
